The sooner this website closes the better. Blockland is a game that should have been closed respectfully without the rotting carcass of the forum in it's shadow. It is a political echo-chamber, a discussion board that doesn't value discussion. Threads are pointlessly stuff out, the only thing users can come up with for threads are news articles and politics. 
People are told not to reply to threads made by one of the most frequent posters because he makes them to troll. Which is directly against the most classic Blockland forum rule in the loving book, but literally no one moderates this stuffhole anymore and when it did happen the moderation was biased enough to see this user through the fingers.
